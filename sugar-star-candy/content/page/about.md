Sometimes I forget. I forget how short and precious life is. I forget to phone or visit or go for breakfast with friends. I forget birthdays and I forget that we are all frail and that we have very short lifespans.

So, I decided to take my Moleskine notebooks online.

What will you find here?

### my slooh adventures

I would like to call myself an amateur astronomer, but seriously, I am just an amateur. That said I hope I can share my enthusiasm and some of the beauty of the universe with you.

### my adventures in code

When I find interesting ways to solve things, I will share them with those geeks who love programming.

### rocks and minerals

Occasionally I will turn my gaze from the stars to Earth. I will share my collection of beautiful rocks and minerals and hope to tell you a story that goes with it.

### fantasy and science fiction

This blog is my attempt at not finishing my novel. Occasionally when I run out of things to post here, I will return to writing it. I will tell you about it when I know how it ends.

### doodles and maps

Somewhere my social media profile says I care for maps and doodles. I really do, if I find a doodle I think you'll like, I will be sure to share it.

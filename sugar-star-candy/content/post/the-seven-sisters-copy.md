> Brighter than our sun,  
> Bright as the window beyond death,  
> The light in the universe  
> Cleans the eyes to stone.  
>   
> They prayed for lives without visions,  
> Free from visions but not blind.  
> They could only drone the prayer,  
> They could not set it down.  
>   
> And windows persisted,  
> And the eyes turned stone.  
> They all had faces like statue Greeks,  
> Marble and calm.  
>   
> And what happened to love  
> In the gleaming universe?  
> It froze in the heart of God,  
> Froze on a spear of light.
>
>   
> Leonard Cohen

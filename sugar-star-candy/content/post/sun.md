heading: What’s brighter than the sun?
first_paragraph: It’s just another star, but for us she means everything. It’s our

> _Brighter than our sun,_
>
> _Bright as the window beyond death,_
>
> _The light in the universe_
>
> _Cleans the eyes to stone._
>
> _They prayed for lives without visions,_
>
> _Free from visions but not blind._
>
> _They could only drone the prayer,_
>
> _They could not set it down._
>
> _And windows persisted,_
>
> _And the eyes turned stone._
>
> _They all had faces like statue Greeks,_
>
> _Marble and calm._

_Leonard Cohen_

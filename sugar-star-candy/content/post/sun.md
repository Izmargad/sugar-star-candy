  It’s just another star, but for us she means everything. It’s our sun. Intimidating and sometimes cruel. Here’s Leonard Cohen writing about the sun and love.

  Brighter than our sun,
  Bright as the window beyond death,
  The light in the universe
  Cleans the eyes to stone.

  They prayed for lives without visions,
  Free from visions but not blind.
  They could only drone the prayer,
  They could not set it down.

  And windows persisted,
  And the eyes turned stone.
  They all had faces like statue Greeks,
  Marble and calm.

This is the Crab Nebula Messier Object 1, it is not the best image out there, but bear with me, it was my first mission to visit this M1 and I am happy to add it to my SLOOH gallery. While you look at the Crab Nebula, travel back in time with me, only a thousand years or so. We set our time travelling machine’s dial to 1054, and we are going to the Sung dynasty. 

When we arrive some time in July of 1054, we see Yan Wei-te, (the Director of Astronomy) prostrated before the Chinese Emperor. He is tasked with the unfortunate burden to report the appearance of a “guest star” out of nowhere – this failure to have predicted the event could lead to public prosecution. The life of an astronomer in the Middle Ages was stressful.

It was completely unintentional. I was still trying to figure out how it all worked. I clicked a few buttons, then embarked on my first quest and purposefully took a photo of our magnificent Sun. My mind melt a little like the wings of Icarus. I flew too close to something unimaginably immense. This was different from looking at a PBS documentary or a BBC show. I took this photo, I observed.

As I scrolled through my photo roll I realised that I had also snapped Caldwell 41. My first image on SLOOH ever. I later sent the photo of this massive orange fruit hanging in the sky as a birthday image to a very dear friend in the US. In retrospect Caldwell 41, deserves some special mention too, how a fumbling, fool with an iPhone manage to capture albeit the nearest open cluster, well studied but still, 153 light-years away.
A spherical group of hundreds of stars in the constellation of Taurus.

I am young and foolish, forever trying to escape the gravity of everything serious. Play and learn, play and learn.
